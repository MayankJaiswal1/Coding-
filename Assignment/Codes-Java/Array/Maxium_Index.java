 * Maximum index a pointer can reach in N steps by avoiding a given index B
Last Updated : 29 Nov, 2023
Given two integers N and B, the task is to print the maximum index a pointer, starting from 0th index can reach in an array of natural numbers(i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5â€¦), say arr[], in N steps without placing itself at index B at any point.


In each step, the pointer can move from the Current Index to a Jumping Index or can remain at the Current Index. 
Jumping Index = Current Index + Step Number

Examples:
Input: N = 3, B = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 

Step 1:
Current Index = 0
Step Number = 1
Jumping Index = 0 + 1 = 1
Step 2:Current Index = 1
Step Number = 2
Jumping Index = 1 + 2 = 3
Step 3:
Current Index = 3
Step Number = 3
Jumping Index = 3 + 3 = 6
Therefore, the maximum index that can be reached is 6.


Input: N = 3, B = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: 


Step 1:
Current Index = 0
Step Number = 1
Jumping Index = 0 + 1 = 1But this is bad index. So pointer remains at the Current Index.
Step 2:
Current Index = 0
Step Number = 2
Jumping Index = 0 + 2 = 2
Step 3:
Current Index = 2
Step Number = 3
Jumping Index = 2 + 3 = 5
Therefore, the maximum index that can be reached is 5.
